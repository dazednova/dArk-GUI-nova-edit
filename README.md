# dArk-GUI-nova-edit
my edit of Arkadya's dArk GUI (original pack at https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/dark-gui-4698161/). my additions were primarily purple highlights, but i also added the font from faithful 64x, and made new versions for 1.7, 1.12, and other versions, and fixed some inconsistencies and potential parity issues  
on occasions on which there are multiple versions of the pack for a given version of the game, denoted jappa and programmer art, this is because these versions have the status effect icons stored in inventory.png. i often but not always like to use new (1.14+) textures in old versions and 1.14, like most things, changed status effect icons, so i made packs for each case just with this one difference to match the default status icons of whatever texture set i'm using
